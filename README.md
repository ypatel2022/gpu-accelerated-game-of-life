# GPU Accelerated Game of Life

This project was created using this [template](https://github.com/SFML/cmake-sfml-project).

## How to Use

1. If you use Linux, install SFML's dependencies using your system package manager. On Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions you can use the following commands:
    ```
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install \
        libxrandr-dev \
        libxcursor-dev \
        libudev-dev \
        libfreetype-dev \
        libopenal-dev \
        libflac-dev \
        libvorbis-dev \
        libgl1-mesa-dev \
        libegl1-mesa-dev
    ```
1. Configure and build your project. Most popular IDEs support CMake projects with very little effort on your part.
    - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) via the [CMake extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cmake-linux)
    - [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=msvc-170)
    - [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/features/cmake-support.html)
    - [Qt Creator](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-project-cmake.html)

    Using CMake from the command line is straightforward as well.

    For a single-configuration generator (typically the case on Linux and macOS):
    ```
    cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build
    ```

    For a multi-configuration generator (typically the case on Windows):
    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=86
    ```
1. Enjoy!
